Multidisciplinary oncology clinicians' experiences delivering spiritual care to patients with cancer and their care partners

Purpose:
        
      
      To understand multidisciplinary healthcare clinicians' meaningful and challenging experiences providing spiritual care to patients with cancer and their care partners.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Multidisciplinary clinicians who participated in a communication training program supported by the National Cancer Institute or a palliative care training for nurses (N = 257) responded to two, open-ended questions about meaningful and challenging experiences of providing spiritual care. A thematic analysis of responses using an iterative, inductive approach was conducted until saturation was reached.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants from nursing (68%), social work (22%), and chaplaincy (10%) responded to open-ended survey questions. Three themes related to meaningful experiences of providing spiritual care emerged: building authentic interpersonal connection with patients and care partners; creating intentional space for patients and care partners to inform spiritual care; and actively supporting patients and care partners in their processes with spirituality. Three themes related to challenging experiences of providing spiritual care emerged: contextual factors and clinical circumstances complicate provision of spiritual care; facing barriers to providing high-quality, patient-centered care; and navigating ethical and logistical issues that affect spiritual and other care.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Clinicians derive meaning from a range of experiences throughout their provision of spiritual care to patients with cancer. However, they also face many challenges in delivering person-centered spiritual care in cancer settings, with some challenges reflecting significant gaps in spiritual care knowledge and training. Findings can guide future training and educational endeavors for multidisciplinary clinicians in the domain of spiritual care.
