Designing a Spiritual Health Model for the Muslim Elderly Living in Nursing Homes

The spiritual health of elderly residents in nursing homes is an essential aspect of their overall health that has been overlooked. There are no specific practical models available in this area. Therefore, the present study aimed to design a model to promote the spiritual health of Muslim elderly residents in nursing homes. This qualitative study is part of a larger study conducted in Iran in 2021 to design a model for the spiritual health of elderly residents in nursing homes in Islamic countries. The first part of the study was conducted using a qualitative method and a grounded theory approach. In the second part, using the findings of the qualitative stage and the theoretical production approach of Walker and Avant (2011), which includes three stages of determining central concepts, reviewing texts, and organizing concepts and statements within a relevant whole, a model for the spiritual health of elderly residents in nursing homes was designed. The resulting model includes assumptions, concepts, objectives, and operational strategies. Some crucial strategies of this model include improving social and organizational infrastructure, spiritual needs assessment, improving the structure and facilities of nursing homes, providing spiritual support, empowering nurses, likewise caregivers, and monitoring and evaluating corrective spiritual care. This model can provide a framework for enhancing the spiritual health of elderly Muslim residents in nursing homes by emphasizing improving the social structure and elderly care centers, assessing spiritual needs, providing spiritual support, and evaluating implemented measures.
