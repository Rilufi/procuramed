Yoga intervention for colorectal cancer survivors: a qualitative study exploring participants' expectations and experiences

Introduction:
        
      
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors often struggle with side effects following treatment such as reduced quality of life, fatigue and psychological distress and need therefore efficient comprehensive interventions. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore CRC survivors' expectations before the yoga intervention as well as their unique experiences beyond those reported with standard questionnaires.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Interpretative phenomenological approach was used in this qualitative study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted before and after a 10-week yoga program (90 min once a week, Hatha Yoga) with CRC survivors enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. Thematic analysis was used to uncover themes present in participants' accounts.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nine patients participated in the interviews, mean interview duration was 27.49 min (SD = 7.71) before and 38.41 min (SD = 15.93) after the intervention. Our analysis identified following themes: (1) representations and expectations from the yoga intervention; (2) course structure and implementation; (3) perceptions and effects of the intervention; (4) differences between the study yoga intervention and other physical activities. The superordinate theme regarding effects of intervention included aspects of intervention at multiple levels such as emotional, physical, behavioral and spiritual.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      This qualitative study provides valuable insight regarding CRC survivors' expectations and experiences following a 10-week yoga intervention. While expectations varied from skepticism to specific symptom improvement, the majority of participants had a positive, open attitude towards yoga. Consistent with participants' experiences, yoga may represent a promising intervention for CRC survivors if the groups' specific concerns are taken into account.
