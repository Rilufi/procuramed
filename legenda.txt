ACTing Spiritually: Integrating Spiritual Care and Mental Health Care within a US Department of Veterans Affairs Inpatient Psychiatric Unit

As a part of the VA's interprofessional fellowship in psychosocial rehabilitation, the authors developed an 8-week spirituality group manual, ACTing Spiritually, which incorporates principles of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) into a spirituality group protocol. The group, administered weekly as possible for 28 weeks on an inpatient psychiatric unit at a veterans affairs (VA) medical center in West Haven, CT, aimed to incorporate veterans' spirituality into their mental health treatment through concepts of acceptance, values, mindfulness, and committed action. ACTing Spiritually ran in tandem with a basic ACT group and the two groups had comparable average group sizes, suggesting interest in ACTing Spiritually similarly compares to interest in a basic ACT group in this context. In addition, development of the group yielded several qualitative findings, including a discussion of the similarities and differences between ACT and spiritual care, clinical gains for chaplains conducting the group, and clinical tensions that arose through the process of integration. The study provided preliminary evidence of the potential feasibility and acceptability of ACTing Spiritually. Next steps should include a formal evaluation of its potential efficacy.
