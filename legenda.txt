The influence of culture and spirituality on maternal grief following stillbirth in China: A qualitative study

Background:
        
      
      Stillbirth is a unique phenomenon with various manifestations influenced by cultural contexts and spiritual beliefs. Chinese cultural and spiritual practices produce different post-stillbirth grief experiences for bereaved mothers in China. However, the majority of research on perinatal loss and grief has been conducted in Western cultures. In the Chinese cultural context, the post-stillbirth grief experience of bereaved mothers may differ from the types of Western bereavement examined in the dominant research.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study investigated the influence of culture and spirituality on grieving mothers who had experienced a stillbirth in China.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This qualitative study was grounded in an interpretivist constructionist epistemology. In-depth interviews were conducted with mothers who had experienced a stillbirth within the previous year. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      A total of 28 women were interviewed by trained interviewers. Three key themes were identified: 1) The influence of culture on grief expression, with four subthemes: restrained expressions of grief, unattainable mourning ceremonies, hospital policy as a barrier to grieving, and others-oriented self; 2) Cultural characteristics of post-stillbirth experiences, with four subthemes: paternalistic medical culture, "Kong yuezi", embarrassment during postpartum visits, and cultural taboos on dealing with deceased babies' possessions; and 3) Finding significance in spiritual healing process, with four subthemes: seeking meaning in the event, accepting and reconciling with the event, reshaping beliefs and views about life and death, and achieving personal growth.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Chinese culture and spirituality have different influences on bereaved mothers' expressions of grief and post-stillbirth healing. This research demonstrates specific aspects of spirituality that contribute to or hinder the grieving process and the different roles of Chinese culture and spirituality for individuals. The findings suggest the need for the development of culturally sensitive interventions and support systems to assist mothers in navigating grief and healing. Future studies could explore the roles of Chinese culture and spirituality over time in the different stages of grief and healing after stillbirth.
