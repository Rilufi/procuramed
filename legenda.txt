Factors associated with health personnel-chaplain interactions in the hospital setting: a cross-sectional survey study

Health personnel may seek chaplain support to discuss stressors related to complex patient cases, difficult team dynamics, and personal issues. In this survey study of 1376 healthcare interprofessional clinicians, participants reported interacting with chaplains most frequently over patient-related stressors in the prior 12 months. Factors associated with chaplain interactions to discuss all three stressors included: reporting chaplains provide spiritual support to health personnel, more years of service, seeking professional help to deal with stressors, and higher levels of secondary traumatic stress. Being a registered nurse (RN) and working in a critical care specialty were associated with increased odds of interactions with a chaplain to discuss patient-related stressors while identifying as Catholic or Protestant was associated with chaplain interactions to discuss team-related and personal stressors. Chaplains should tailor interventions to promote health personnel's spiritual well-being based on patient-related, team-related, and personal stressors. Healthcare institutions which do not employ chaplains should advocate for this resource. Leaders in healthcare settings with chaplains should promote increased staff awareness that chaplains are available to support wellbeing by discussing patient, team, or personal stressors.
