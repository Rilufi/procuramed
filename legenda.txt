Resilience and coping during protracted conflict: a comparative analysis of general and evacuees populations

Background:
        
      
      On October 7th, 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, triggering a conflict with Israel in the Gaza Strip. This ongoing war, now six months old, has also seen threats from Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as from Yemen and Iran. The precarious security situation along Israel's southern and northern borders led to extensive evacuations, with residents relocating within Israel under uncertain conditions concerning their return and property safety. This study compares resilience (societal, SR; community, CR; and individual, IR), hope, morale, distress symptoms (anxiety and depression symptoms), and perceived danger between general Hebrew-speaking adults and evacuee adults a few months post-conflict initiation.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data was collected using structured self-reported questionnaires focusing on resilience and coping strategies, administered through two online panel companies. The general population data was collected from January 14-21, 2024 (N = 1,360), and the evacuees' data from March 1-9, 2024 (N = 372; 133 from the north, 239 from the south).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Evacuees reported lower SR and CR, hope, and morale, and higher distress symptoms and perceived danger compared to the general population. No differences in IR were found. Regression analyses identified different primary predictors of SR for each group: hope for the general population and governmental support for evacuees. Additionally, IR significantly predicted outcomes only among evacuees, whereas age, religiosity, and education were significant predictors solely in the general population. One notable similarity emerged: CR served as the second most influential predictor in both samples.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The entire population of Israel is affected by the ongoing war, yet evacuees endure a disproportionately severe impact, with potential for increased harm as the conflict persists. The adjustment to a new wartime emergency routine is more complex for evacuees than for the general population. It is crucial for policy and decision-makers to address the distinct differences between evacuees and the general populace to effectively meet their specific needs. Yet, it should be acknowledged that the evacuees represent a heterogenic group, necessitating a detailed subdivision into subgroups to accurately assess and address their unique challenges.
