Effect of the Radical Remission Multimodal Intervention on Quality of Life of People with Cancer

Introduction: The Radical Remission Multimodal Intervention (RRMI) was developed by Kelly A. Turner, PhD, after analyzing more than 1500 cases of cancer survivors experiencing radical remission (a.k.a. spontaneous regression) across all cancer types and extracting key lifestyle factors shared by these cancer survivors. The RRMI workshops provide instruction on these lifestyle factors to participants with cancer and give them tools to help navigate their cancer recovery journey. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the effect of the RRMI on the quality of life (QOL) of people with cancer. Methods: This was a pre-post outcome study. Data were collected, between January 2019 and January 2022, from 200 eligible adults of all cancer types, who attended the RRMI workshops (online and in-person). Participants were asked to complete questionnaires online, at baseline (i.e., before the intervention) and at month 1 and month 6 post-intervention. The RRMI workshops were led by certified Radical Remission health coaches. Participants completed the RRMI with personalized action plans for them to implement. The primary outcome QOL measure was the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being Scale (FACIT-Sp). Mixed-effects regression models were used to examine differences in FACIT-Sp score between month 1 and baseline, as well as month 6 and baseline. Models controlled for baseline score, covariates (including age, ethnic group, and body mass index), timepoints (month 1 or 6), training type (online or in-person), adherence score, and interaction between timepoints and adherence score. Results: 92% of participants were women, 77% were Non-Hispanic White, 88% were living in the US, and 66.5% were not living alone. One-quarter had breast cancer. Mean age ± SD was 55.3 ± 11.5 years. Final mixed-effects model analyses showed a significant increase in FACIT-Sp score of 9.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.2-12.8) points at month 1 (P < .0001) and 9.7 (95% CI: 6.4-13.0) points at month 6 (P < .0001) compared with baseline, a 7.7% and 10.8% improvement, respectively. Conclusion: The RRMI was found to significantly improve the overall QOL of participants at month 1. This improvement was maintained at month 6 post-intervention. Our findings suggest that people with cancer can benefit from the RRMI.
