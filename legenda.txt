Is there an association among spirituality, resilience and empathy in medical students?

Background:
        
      
      Spirituality has religious and nonreligious dimensions and is often linked to well-being, positive emotions, connection and meaning in life. Both empathy and resilience are important in medical training and future professional practice since they are considered core skills related to professionalism and patient care. Our study aimed to understand the relationships among spirituality, resilience, and empathy in medical students. We also aimed to determine whether there are differences by gender and between medical students in different years of a medical program.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Medical students (n = 1370) of the first to fourth years of a six-year medical program, from six medical schools, completed questionnaires to assess empathy (Jefferson Empathy Scale and Davis Multidimensional Interpersonal Reactivity Scale) and resilience (Wagnild & Young Scale) and to rate their spirituality.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Medical students with high spirituality showed higher scores for both resilience and empathy (p < 0.001). In addition, we observed higher levels of both spirituality and empathy, but not resilience, in female medical students than in male medical students. In contrast, we did not detect significant differences in spirituality, empathy, or resilience between students in different years of medical school.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Medical students with high levels of spirituality have also higher scores for both empathy and resilience. Spirituality, empathy and resilience have similar values for students in different years of a medical program.
