The Intersection of Faith and Neurodiversity: Unraveling Religiosity in Autistic Adolescents-A Critical Review Analysis

This literature review aims to explore religiosity, faith, and related beliefs in autistic adolescents. The term religiosity was used interchangeably with various related concepts such as faith, spirituality, and religious beliefs, and a broader, multifaceted approach encompassing the cognitive, subjective, social, cultural, and emotional domains of religiosity is analyzed in this population subgroup. In alignment with the neurodiversity paradigm, this review endeavors to adopt an inclusive lens toward autism spectrum conditions, appreciating the spectrum of cognitive and behavioral differences and highlighting the importance of recognizing strengths and challenges alike, reflecting the nuanced discourse surrounding neurodiversity and autism spectrum conditions. However, terms such as "high-functioning autism" and "disorder" were used where needed to reflect the journals included in the review. A systematic search was conducted by accessing academic search engines such as APA PsycInfo, APA PsycArticles, APA PsycTests, and PubMed. Only peer-reviewed articles written in English and performed on human subjects were included using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Several recurring themes were identified from the 13 articles selected after review for relevance and quality. The most important finding was the association of different terminologies and features while exploring "religiosity in autism." Thirty-nine key themes were identified, which were grouped into six major themes. These were religious faith, spirituality, and its expression in autistic adolescents; religious behaviors and practices of autistic adolescents; cognition and religion in autistic teens; social and cultural influences on religiosity in autistic young ones; parents' and carers' influence, perspectives, and experiences about faith and spirituality on autistic adolescents; and perceived benefits of faith to autistic teens: parents and adolescent perspectives. Looking at the concept of religiosity and spirituality as a whole, it can be inferred from the available research included in this review that religiosity (cognitive abilities, behaviors, and experiences) in a subset of autistic adolescents (high-functioning autism) might not be significantly subdued as compared to neurotypical adolescents. However, there is not enough research to conclude the same or the opposite for autistic adolescents in general. When found, reserved religiosity could be attributed to a plethora of factors, and decreased mental ability or mentalization, empathy, or imagination did not seem to be the sole or primary predictors or contributors to religiosity. The role of culture, parents, carers, and religious affiliations was significant and might be a stronger contributor to religiosity and its expression than other previously argued predictors like mentalization. Many autistic teens and their carers regard religiosity and spirituality as essential domains in their and their children's lives, want their children to be given opportunities to be a part of religious groups and affiliations, and look forward to government, religious, and healthcare authorities actively supporting them in this domain. The findings call for policymakers, religious leaders, and stakeholders to devise strategies for inclusion and support for autistic adolescents. The possible role of religion as a resource and coping strategy for these children and their families is worth exploring.
