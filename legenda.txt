The Expanding Role of United States Healthcare Chaplains in Clinical Ethics

Healthcare chaplains in the United States increasingly report being tasked by their organizations to participate in the formal work of clinical ethics, by serving on ethics committees, performing clinical ethics consultations, or leading clinical ethics programs. This mapping study documents that professionally-trained chaplains possess a number of skills and attributes that enhance their capability for this work; however, they often lack certain knowledge specific to the discipline of clinical ethics that is needed for roles they are being asked to perform. The professional associations of both chaplaincy and clinical ethics are encouraged to address this educational gap for the benefit of both disciplines.
