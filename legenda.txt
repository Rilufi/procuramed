Holistic Physical Assessment: A New Framework for Nursing Practice Honoring the Whole Person

Scholars have argued that standard physical assessment is based on a medical framework instead of nursing theories and philosophy. We argue that standard physical assessment is task-oriented, lacking emphasis on the whole-person and neglecting a least-to-most invasive assessment process. While holistic health assessment is person-centered and multidimensional; addressing aspects such as physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being, there is not a comprehensive explanation on how to holistically perform the physical examination portion of a holistic health assessment. Proposed is a new framework for holistic physical assessment in the hospital environment, honoring the whole-person, their background, and lived experiences. The framework builds on the holistic nursing philosophy, integrative nursing principles, and trauma-informed approach, and systematically arranges physical assessment from least invasive to most. The seven sequential assessment steps incorporate self-care and awareness into the preparation and closure of the assessment-(1) the self, (2) the space, (3) least invasive, (4) moderate invasive, (5) most invasive, (6) the space, and (7) the self. This framework can have significant implications for nursing practice and education settings, providing valuable guidance for a holistic physical assessment that emphasizes whole-person care.
