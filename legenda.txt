"It's not a one-person show" E-learning course in neuropalliative care: A qualitative analysis of participants' educational gains and self-reported outcomes

Objectives:
        
      
      Patients with progressive neurologic illness still lack access to quality palliative care services. Barriers to the comprehensive provision of neuropalliative care include gaps in palliative care education. To address this barrier, a novel international model of neuropalliative care education e-learning program was launched in 2022.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This is a qualitative study on the self-reported learning outcomes and educational gains of participants of a neuropalliative care e-learning course.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Thematic analysis shows changes in the participants' perceptions of neuropalliative care and several specific educational gains. After attending the course, participants recognized neuropalliative care as a multiprofessional and interdisciplinary effort requiring more than medical knowledge and disease-specific treatment skills. They gained understanding of the complexity of prognosis in neurological diseases, as well as ethical concepts as the basis to approach difficult decisions. Valuing the needs of patients and caregivers, as well as honest and open communication were recognized as key components of the caring process. In particular, providing emotional support and building relationships to enhance the spiritual component of care were avidly discussed as essential nonmedical treatment options.
    


          Significance of results:
        
      
      E-learning courses are helping to close the gaps in healthcare professionals' knowledge and skills about neuropalliative care.
