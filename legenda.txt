Knowledge, attitudes, and practices of caregivers with children diagnosed with epilepsy attending a pediatric outpatient clinic: a descriptive, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia

Background:
        
      
      Caregivers' knowledge and attitudes influence help-seeking behavior and treatment decisions of patients with epilepsy, which in turn significantly impacts epilepsy care. In Ethiopia, epilepsy is often misunderstood, associated with misconceptions and accompanied by persistent negative attitudes. The objective of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of caregivers of children with epilepsy.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a hospital-based survey at the Yekatit 12 Hospital Pediatric Neurology Clinic, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, between May and July 2022. We invited caregivers of children with epilepsy taking one or more daily anti-seizure medications to participate. Caregivers were invited to complete a structured questionnaire with guidance from a trained nurse to estimate knowledge and attitudes towards epilepsy and its treatment. Knowledge and attitudes were categorized as "good" and "favorable" (correct answers to â‰¥ 50% of questions) or "bad" and "unfavorable" (< 50% correct answers), respectively. Attitudes towards standard care versus non-standard (e.g., spiritual) care were also estimated.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 120 caregivers completed the questionnaire. Many caregivers were familiar with the term 'epilepsy', with more than half (51.7%) having heard or read about it previously. The reported causes of epilepsy varied, with birth injury being the most common cause (44 out of 120 caregivers). Notably, there was association between the caregiver's gender and their knowledge score, with a p-value = 0.05. Caregivers exposed to information about epilepsy through hearing or reading demonstrated significantly higher levels of knowledge, with a p-value < 0.001. Additionally, knowing someone with epilepsy other than the index child was significantly associated with higher knowledge scores (p-value < 0.001). The study also revealed negative attitudes toward epilepsy: for example, 56.7% of surveyed caregivers believed it is unlikely that a child with epilepsy has normal cognitive abilities and 39.1% believed they should never be allowed to attend regular school. Additionally, a high proportion of caregivers (70%) sought alternative treatments (e.g., spiritual help) alongside standard medical care.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A significant knowledge gap was identified among caregivers, revealing prevalent misconceptions and negative attitudes. Improving epilepsy awareness, attitudes, and practices among caregivers will potentially contribute to overall improved quality of life for children with epilepsy.
