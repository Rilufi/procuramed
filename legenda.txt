Relationships between Applied Mindfulness Practice, Chronic Pain, and Pain-Related Functioning in Veterans

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been shown to improve chronic pain and associated conditions like depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. However, there is limited research on how Veterans with chronic pain apply mindfulness skills to manage pain in daily life. This cross-sectional study examined the association between applied mindfulness practice, pain, and several pain-related conditions among 1,737 Veterans with chronic pain prior to enrollment in a trial of two MBIs. Applied mindfulness practice was assessed using the Applied Mindfulness Process Scale (AMPS). Outcomes included pain interference, pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, PTSD, physical function, and social participation. Higher overall AMPS scores, as well as the positive and negative emotional regulation subscales of the AMPS, were associated with less pain interference and catastrophizing, as well as better outcomes for all pain-related conditions. The positive emotional regulation subscale had the strongest associations with outcomes. There was no significant association between the AMPS and pain intensity. Results suggest applied mindfulness practice, especially positive emotional regulation, may improve pain and functioning. In addition, the AMPS shows promise as a process measure of mindfulness skills applied in daily life. Additional research is needed to examine different aspects of mindfulness in the context of MBIs. PERSPECTIVE: This article describes the relationship between applied mindfulness practice and pain-related outcomes, prior to a mindfulness-based intervention, using a novel measure of mindfulness practice. These findings underscore the importance of measuring applied mindfulness practice prior to and during clinical interventions to treat chronic pain.
