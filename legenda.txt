Correlation of nurses' perception of spirituality and spiritual care with spiritual care practices in Indonesia: A cross-sectional survey

Background:
        
      
      Spiritual care is essential to nursing practice, contributing to holistic patient care. However, the relationship between nurses' perceptions of spirituality and spiritual care with their engagement in spiritual care practices remains underexplored, particularly in Indonesia. Understanding this relationship is crucial for enhancing the quality of care provided to patients.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This study aimed to examine the correlation between nurses' perceptions of spirituality and spiritual care with their spiritual care practices in Indonesia.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A cross-sectional survey design was employed, involving a total of 300 nurses working in healthcare facilities across Indonesia. Data were collected via an online survey conducted from March to May 2024, using validated questionnaires: the Indonesian adaptation of the Spirituality and Spiritual Care Rating Scale (SSCRS) and the Nurse Spiritual Care Therapeutic Scale (NSCTS). Spearman Rank Correlation was used to assess the relationship between nurses' perceptions of spirituality and their engagement in spiritual care practices.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study found that nurses held a positive perception of spirituality, with a mean score of 3.85 (SD = 0.41) regarding statements related to spirituality and spiritual care. However, they reported providing spiritual care only occasionally, with an average frequency of 3-6 times over a 72 to 80-hour work period. There was a significant positive correlation (r = 0.235, p <0.001) of nurses' perception of spirituality and spiritual care with their engagement in spiritual care practices.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The study highlights the need for targeted education and training to enhance nurses' competencies in spiritual care practices. Addressing spiritual needs is vital for holistic patient care, and improving nurses' perceptions and practices in this area can significantly benefit patient well-being.
