Psychometric Evaluation of the Persian Version of Spiritual Self-Care Practice Scale in Iranian Patients with Cancer

Spiritual self-care is defined as a set of patient-centered or family-centered spiritual activities aimed at promoting health and well-being. In chronic diseases such as cancer, the responsibility for care typically falls on the patient or their family, necessitating an accurate assessment of the patient's self-care practices to achieve this goal. The objective of this study was to translate, culturally adapt, and examine the psychometrics of the Persian version of the spiritual self-care practice scale (SSCPS) in cancer patients. This scale is designed to be administered directly to patients to assess their spiritual self-care practices. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the oncology ward in Afzalipoor Hospital, Javad Al-Aemeh Clinic, and Physicians Clinics affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences in Kerman, southeast Iran. The study included qualitative and quantitative assessments of face validity, content validity, item analysis, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (construct validity), and reliability. Data collection took place between March 20, 2023, and December 30, 2023. The scale's content validity index was calculated to be 0.948, with mostly minor revision comments for most items. The item-content validity indices ranged from 0.7 to 1. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a five-factor solution with 23 items, explaining 61.251% of the total variance. The identified factors were labeled as 'personal and interpersonal spiritual practices,' 'shaping and strengthening relationship practices,' 'religious practices,' 'physical spiritual practices,' and 'reshaping relationship practices.' Most of the confirmatory factor analysis indices were satisfactory (χ2/df = 1.665, CFI = 0.934, IFI = 0.935, RMSEA = 0.058). The Cronbach's α coefficient for the total scale was 0.89, while it ranged from 0.596 to 0.882 for the subscales. The Persian version of SSCPS with 23 items demonstrates reliability and effectiveness in assessing the spiritual practice performance of Iranian cancer patients. Compared to the original version, the Persian adaptation of SSCPS is concise, making it a suitable instrument for future research and practice on spiritual self-care among Iranian cancer patients.
