Health workers' perceptions of epilepsy and its treatment implications: A survey of nurses and other healthcare workers' in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia

In Ethiopia, the epilepsy knowledge gap among healthcare workers remains high. In this study, we conducted a survey among health care workers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, exploring their knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions about social inclusion and exclusion regarding epilepsy. Furthermore, we analysed if and how these factors influence the management and quality of care provided. During a training workshop, 50 participants completed the survey. Nurses made up 22% of the participants, midwives comprised 11%, health officers constituted 16%, and medical officers represented 4%. Of the respondents, 69% were male, and 59% had experience in treating patients with epilepsy. This study showed that while 51% of respondents correctly identified epilepsy as being diagnosed after two seizures, many were uncertain about the criteria. Although 90% believed epilepsy is treatable, some were unsure or held misconceptions. Regarding its contagiousness, 82% correctly stated it is not contagious, but some held incorrect beliefs. Treatment options varied, with most recognizing clinical medicines, but some still believed in alternative methods like spiritual or herbal healing. Additionally, understanding of person-centered care was lacking, with several respondents admitting they were unfamiliar with the concept. The factors contributing to the epilepsy treatment gap in Ethiopia were a lack of comprehensive knowledge among healthcare workers about epilepsy, misconceptions such as the belief that epilepsy is contagious, inadequate management practices, challenges in accessing and securing medications due to shortages, and limited community awareness about the condition. Additionally, the study exposed a concerning gap in understanding of person-centered care among some healthcare workers. This study underscores the urgent need for targeted training programs, healthcare policies, and community awareness initiatives to enhance the quality of care for individuals with epilepsy in Ethiopia and similar settings.
