The Opioid Epidemic and Faith-Based Responses in Southern Appalachia, USA: An Exploration of Factors for Successful Cross-Sector Collaboration

This study aimed to identify factors for successful cross-sector collaboration with faith-based responses to the opioid epidemic in southern Appalachia. In-depth interviews were conducted with representatives from organizations responding to the opioid epidemic (N = 25) and persons who have experienced opioid dependency (N = 11). Stakeholders perceived that collaboration is hindered by stigma, poor communication, and conflicting medical and spiritual approaches to opioid dependency. Collaborations are facilitated by cultivating compassion and trust, sharing information along relational lines, and discerning shared commitments while respecting different approaches. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications for both religious leaders and potential cross-sector collaborators.
