The influence of sociodemographic factors on parental health-seeking behavior for illnesses among the pediatric age group in Karachi: A cross-sectional study

Background:
        
      
      Health-seeking behavior (HSB) is an individual's reaction to sickness, for which they seek medical attention, regardless of the form such care may take. Poor HSB is frequently associated with lower health outcomes and greater mortality and disease rates in a nation. Sociodemographic factors, including age, gender, family structure, occupation, ethnicity, and rates of literacy and poverty, can influence a person's HSB. This study would benefit Pakistani parents of the paediatric population to make more informed health choices for their children.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      This study aims to determine the influence of sociodemographic factors on parental HSB for illnesses among the pediatric age group in Karachi.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      A cross-sectional study was conducted in which 214 parents were interviewed about their choices for health-seeking healthcare for their pediatric children of the pediatric age group (birth-18 years), who were attending the pediatric OPD and wards at Dr. Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital, Karachi in May 2023. Only parents or guardians with sick children were included. Their sociodemographic characteristics and health-seeking choices were asked. Informed consent was obtained, and all data were recorded. SPSS version 25 was used for analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      For the first choice, the majority of parents (82.7%) preferred to seek healthcare for their children from medical doctors, followed by spiritual healers (10.7%), traditional healers (5.6%), and homoeopathic doctors (0.9%). For the second choice, the highest percentage was for a doctor (76.2%), followed by a spiritual healer (18.7%), a homoeopathic doctor (3.3%), and a traditional healer (1.9%). A significant correlation was found between the first visit and the decision makers (p = 0.019), the father's education level of the father (p = 0.001), the mother's occupation of the mother (p = 0.019), and the mother's education level of the mother (p = 0.001).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Sociodemographic characteristics greatly influence parents' HSBs of parents for their children. Despite having low-paying jobs and being uneducated, most people choose to refer to a doctor for their child due to awareness.
