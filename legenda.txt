"An obedient wife never says "no" to her virtual god." High fertility conceptions and barriers to contraceptive use among mothers of Southern Pakistan: a qualitative study

Issue:
        
      
      Biomedical approaches want to change locals' behaviors without understanding the sociocultural rationales and contextualizing the cultural and structural backdrop of women's agency.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      This study explored the perceptions and practices of rural mothers about fertility and reproductive health and further examine the lack of preference for contraception and birth spacing in Southern Pakistan.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      Using purposive sampling we recruited 15 healthcare providers and 20 mothers from Southern Punjab. Key informants and in-depth interviews were used for data collection. We extracted themes and sub themes to analyse qualitative data.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Five major themes identified preventing birth spacing and contraceptive use: (1) cultural barriers (2) economic difficulties and demographic factors; (3) gender-related hurdles; (4) spiritual and religious obstacles, and (5) medico-ethical complications. Nearly, ten sub-themes contributing to these major themes were: custom of girls' early marriages, in-laws' permission for contraception, women's concern for medical complications and preference for safer methods, misuse of contraceptive methods by the medical community, mothers' perception of contraception as sinful act and controlling birth is against faith, economic and rural-ethnic factors for high fertility, masculine disapproval of condom use, and wishing to give birth to male children.
    


          Suggestions:
        
      
      We advocate for understanding the sociocultural explanations for low contraceptive use and urge practice of more natural methods of birth spacing over commercial solutions. The study suggests socio-economic development of less developed communities and empowerment of poor, illiterate, and rural women along with behavior change communication strategies.
