A time study of ACPE certified educators

This is a descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study of how ACPE Certified Educators (CEs) allocated their time among varied responsibilities in calendar year 2021. Using a structured interview assisted survey instrument, 25 CEs at academic medical centers/university teaching hospitals were surveyed via Zoom/Phone. Results found a median commitment of 58% of time on clinical pastoral education (CPE) activities (38% to teaching and 20% to administration). CEs (7) who also serve as Spiritual Care Department directors/managers spent 45% on CPE and 30% on department activities. Sixteen of the CEs strongly or somewhat agreed that CE involvement in direct patient/family/staff care was important, yet median CE involvement in such care was 5%. Future studies should examine CE time commitment levels in a broader sample of ACPE accredited institutions.
