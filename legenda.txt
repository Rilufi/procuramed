Pediatric chaplains iterative process to address religious & spiritual struggle: a qualitative study

The growing body of literature on religious and spiritual (R/S) struggles consistently highlights its association with various health outcomes in Pediatrics. Chaplains or spiritual care providers, as members of interdisciplinary teams, frequently offer spiritual care to patients and families grappling with R/S struggles. However, there is a paucity of literature demonstrating how chaplains address R/S struggle in their practice. This study aimed to construct a theory describing the process by which pediatric chaplains conceptualize and address it. Employing a constructivist Grounded Theory study design, we sought to comprehend the approaches pediatric chaplains utilize in addressing R/S struggles. Following a semi-structured interview guide, we interviewed twelve Board Certified or Board Certification-eligible chaplains. Findings reveal that chaplains use an iterative three-phase process to address R/S struggles. Thirteen categories emerged, which were further organized into four major themes: Assessing, Processing, Intervening, and Navigating Limitations. A model depicting this iterative process was constructed.
