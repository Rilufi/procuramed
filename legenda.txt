Essential competencies for healthcare chaplains: insights from hiring managers and implications for chaplaincy education

This first-of-its-kind study explored the essential competencies healthcare chaplaincy hiring managers (HCHMs) sought for entry-level healthcare chaplains (HCCs). We conducted qualitative interviews with 16 HCHMs and using reflexive thematic analysis (RTA), developed nine key themes: interpersonal skills, teamwork, knowledge of family and group dynamics, understanding of the healthcare system, professionalism, proficiency in spiritual assessment, effective communication, commitment to lifelong learning, and knowledge of various religious and spiritual beliefs, extending beyond one's own faith tradition. These themes reflected HCCs roles as healthcare professionals who contribute to patient care, interdisciplinary collaboration, and spiritual leadership responsibilities. The study underscored the need for chaplaincy education to integrate healthcare-specific coursework, interprofessional training, cultural and religious humility, and deeper knowledge of diverse belief systems. Developing and incorporating curriculum standards based on these themes could enhance the readiness of HCCs to deliver comprehensive care and meet the dynamic demands of diverse patient populations within today's healthcare landscape.
