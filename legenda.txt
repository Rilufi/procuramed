Chaplain interventions and outcomes in outpatient settings: a scoping review

As chaplaincy is increasingly practiced in outpatient settings, further understanding is needed of what it entails and is accomplishing within this unique context. This scoping review summarizes 42 articles that describe the types of spiritual care interventions and programs offered by chaplains in outpatient settings, and their outcomes. Findings support that chaplaincy is practiced in outpatient settings, especially in palliative care, oncology, and primary care. Interventions are delivered by chaplains as the sole interventionist, and by interdisciplinary teams with chaplain participants. Results show that outpatient chaplain interventions are feasible and acceptable, with positive psychological and spiritual outcomes. More studies with consistent outcome measurements, and structured chaplain interventions are needed to draw further conclusions about the effectiveness of outpatient chaplain interventions.
