Spiritual Health, Anxiety and Fear of Childbirth in Iran: Is there Any Relationship?

The most common reason for mothers' request for a cesarean section is fear of childbirth. The present study was conducted to determine the relationship between spiritual health and anxiety and fear of childbirth in pregnant women. This correlational cross-sectional study was performed on 426 pregnant women who were referred to Yahyanejad Hospital in Babol, Iran, during 2018-2021. These pregnant women were hospitalized in the maternity ward for vaginal delivery. Convenience sampling bases on inclusion criteria were done to select the subjects. The questionnaires used in this study included Demographic and Obstetric Questionnaire, Anxiety and Fear of Childbirth Questionnaire by Pirdel et al., and Palutzian & Ellison Spiritual Well-being Scale. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16 using descriptive and analytical indicators and linear and multiple correlation tests. The results of the study showed that all pregnant women experienced moderate (23.1) or severe (76.9) fear and anxiety, and none of the women had low fear and anxiety. Moreover, all women in this study had moderate (50.5) or high (49.5) spiritual health. The results of linear regression test showed that there is a significant and inverse relationship between spiritual health and anxiety and fear of childbirth (R: - 0.12, CI - 0.14, - 0.019, P = 0.011). Furthermore, the results of multivariate linear regression test after adjustments for intervening demographic and midwifery variables showed a significant relationship between spiritual health (R: - 0.12, CI - 0.14, - 0.02, P = 0.009), education level and number of pregnancies, and anxiety and fear of childbirth. The results of the study showed that with the increase in spiritual health, anxiety and fear of childbirth decreases. Therefore, it can be inferred that women need spiritual care in addition to medical care to deal with fear and anxiety during pregnancy and childbirth.
