Factors influencing the ability of family caregivers of Alzheimer's patients within Iranian families to continue and persist in their caregiving roles: a qualitative study

Background:
        
      
      Understanding the motivations driving family members to continue caring for individuals with Alzheimer's disease is crucial for enhancing social support programs within community health systems. This study specifically explores the factors influencing Iranian family caregivers' ability to persist in their caregiving roles.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This qualitative study was conducted using conventional content analysis with 22 participants in 2022 in Babol (a city in northern Iran). The inclusion criteria for the study included caregivers of Alzheimer's patients who had been the primary caregivers for at least one year for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The sampling method was purposive, ensuring maximum variation in social position, demographic status, and stages of Alzheimer's disease after the onset of symptoms. In this research, data were collected from caregivers of Alzheimer's patients through semi-structured interviews and in-depth individual interviews. The data were analyzed using MAXQDA software.
    


          Results:
        
      
      One category and four subcategories were identified to explain the continuity of the caring role in family caregivers of Alzheimer's patients. The category was "on the Fence of the Caring Role." The subcategories included Commitment to Care (Being Determined, Being Indebted, Feeling Dutiful), Coercion to Care (Giving in to the Caring Role Due to Family Requirements, Patient Care Due to Financial Problems), Socio-Cultural Beliefs and Concerns (Spiritual and Religious Tendencies, Social Stigma and Social Fears), and Attachment and Love for the Patient (Feeling Pity, Feeling Nostalgia for Kinship).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Family caregivers are deeply engaged in their roles, often feeling trapped by various pressures. Recognizing these dimensions can inform policymakers and health practitioners in developing targeted interventions, such as respite care programs, financial support, and community resources, aimed at alleviating caregiver burden and enhancing the quality of care for patients. By addressing the complexities of the caregiver experience, effective strategies can be implemented to support both patients and their caregivers, ultimately improving health outcomes within the community.
