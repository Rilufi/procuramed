Beliefs negatively mediate adolescents' and adults' knowledge about sickle cell disease prevention and relationship choices; a one-center exploratory study in Central Region, Ghana

Background:
        
      
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common monogenic inheritable condition in sub-Saharan Africa. 30% of Ghanaians are estimated to be carriers creating a condition for stable SCD penetrance. Being inheritable, SCD is scientifically preventable through intentional spousal selection. This study therefore explored young adults' knowledge, beliefs and prevention strategies regarding SCD.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This exploratory study employed a mixed-methods approach (semi-structured questionnaires and focus group discussion [FGD]) to explore the SCD knowledge and beliefs of participants (15-49 years). The data collection was intentionally sequential; initial administration of 386 questionnaires and then followed by the FGD (16 participants). FGD was thematically analysed whereas quantitative data was explored using structural equation modeling (SEM); p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant under two-tailed assumptions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Whereas 98.7% reported having heard about SCD, < 50% got the information through formal education. Overall, 49.7% knew their respective SCD status; the proportion increased with age (48.8% in < 30 years vs 64.4% in â‰¥ 30 years old), or higher degree status (48.8% in undergraduates vs 67.4% in postgraduates). Moreover, whereas nine-in-ten correctly identified that SCD is hereditable, three-in-ten believed that having a SCD child was a matter of fate. Our FGD revealed that whereas curses, and spiritual attack were misconceived as potential causes of SCD, stigmatization associated with SCD was a major concern. The SEM demonstrated that one's knowledge about SCD prevention is significantly positively associated with relationship choices (b = 0.757, p < 0.05). Also, a participant's knowledge about SCD preventive strategies was significantly associated with the individual's beliefs about SCD (b = 0.335; p < 0.05). However, a participant's SCD beliefs negatively mediated SCD preventive strategies-relationship choices association.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      SCD beliefs likely transform linear quantitative associations into a complex non-linear interaction; public health campaigns ought to unearth and address SCD beliefs to maximize achieving the intended targets.
