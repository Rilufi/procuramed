Changes in Time Perception and Coping Strategies in Young Adults With Cancer: A Qualitative Study

Background:
        
      
      A cancer diagnosis is a traumatic event. Youths, in the most crucial stage in a person's life course, are more susceptible to the influence of cancer. The diagnosis disrupts the original life and time plans of young adults with cancer, resulting in a reconstruction of time perception and changes in coping strategies.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      The aim of this study was to explore the changes in time perception and coping strategies in young adults with cancer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A phenomenological research methodology was used in the qualitative study. Thirty-one young adults with cancer were recruited. Semistructured interviews were conducted with them, and the interview data were analyzed using Colaizzi's 7-step analysis method.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The study revealed 3 themes related to changes in time perception: perceived alterations in the speed of time, changes in remaining available time, and shifts in time preferences. Five themes were identified regarding coping strategies for changes in time perception: self-regulation of emotions, establishing spiritual beliefs, planning time effectively, returning to family life, and closure of the inner self.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Identifying changes in time perception among young adults with cancer through the speed of time, remaining available time, and time preference and guiding patients in adopting positive coping strategies can offer more effective cancer support and care for patients.
    


          Implications for practice:
        
      
      Healthcare professionals should pay attention to the changes in time perception in young adults with cancer and guide them to cope positively.
