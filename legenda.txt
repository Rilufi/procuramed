      Coping with a patient's death is one of the most challenging events faced by healthcare professionals in clinical practice. A broad understanding of the coping strategies used by healthcare professionals is fundamental to the development of effective interventions and the provision of good bereavement care. This review aims to systematically synthesize the coping experience of healthcare professionals in the course of their work when they are confronted with patient deaths.

          Results:
        
      
      Thirty studies involving 545 participants met the inclusion criteria and scored a high level on quality assessment ranging from 9.0 to 10.0. Six themes were identified: emotional coping, cognitive coping, behavioral coping, relational coping, spiritual coping, and occupational coping.
