Participants' Perspectives on Diabetes Self-Management Programming at Church: Faith-Placed Versus Faith-Based Approach

Purpose:
        
      
      The purpose of the study was to explore Hispanic adults' experiences participating in the Building a Healthy Temple diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) cluster randomized trial and collect their insights on intervention approach, delivery, content, impact, and suggested improvements for future DSMES programs delivered at church.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Focus groups were conducted with participants from both intervention arms, that is, faith-based (FB) group and faith-placed group. Participating churches were predominantly Hispanic and located in San Antonio, Texas. Focus groups were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Inductive content analysis was performed with the assistance of NVivo software to code and categorize emerging themes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 138 adult participants took part in the current study. Participants in both groups highly valued the church setting for its convenient location and support system and reported positive changes in diabetes-related beliefs, knowledge, skills, behaviors, and health outcomes. FB participants appreciated the incorporation of spiritual teachings and facilitation by lay leaders, which created a sense of empowerment and improved outlook on living with diabetes.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Church holds promise as a setting for DSMES program delivery in Hispanic communities. Church-based DSMES programs using a FB approach may further facilitate program adoption and sustainability.
