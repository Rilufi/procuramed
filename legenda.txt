Global perspectives on the traditional approaches used in the treatment of schizophrenia: A systematic review

Background:
        
      
      Traditional healing considers a holistic approach when diagnosing and treating patients for mental ailments, and is the preferred approach globally.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      This review documented traditional healing approaches for treatment of schizophrenia used in different regions globally.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      PICO framework was used to facilitate literature search from Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, Scopus, APA PsycINFO, and Web search. Studies documenting methods of treatment from the perspective of traditional healers, patients and/or caregivers were included and also studies which investigated herbal plants used in traditional healing in vitro and in vivo were included. Review articles, magazine/newspaper articles, editorials, letters, comments/opinion articles, and articles with inaccessible full text were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed using MMAT and SYRCLE tools. University Capacity Development Programme funded this review.
    


          Results:
        
      
      74 articles were included, these documented traditional healing practices used in Africa, Asia, America, Europe, and Oceania. Common approach globally was herbal medicine. Other reported methods included faith-based healing, consultation with the ancestors, performing rituals, acupuncture, and music and yoga therapies. Inhumane approaches included starving, beating, cutting and confining patients. In some cases, traditional healing was used as adjunctive treatment. The overall risk of bias for studies in this review was low.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Traditional healing contributes in bridging the treatment gap for schizophrenia in developing countries. However, there is a lack of standardisation of the approaches employed in the different regions, and the safety and effectiveness of some of these approaches remain questionable.
