Perceptions of patients and healthcare providers regarding barriers and enablers of HIV anti-retroviral therapy among women at a regional hospital in Ghana: implications for national HIV/AIDS control

Background:
        
      
      The Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic has created a lot of devastation over the last four decades and continues to be a public health threat. Anti-retroviral treatment (ART), a group of medications that people who have been diagnosed with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection take, has been shown to be efficacious and has significantly improved the fight against the disease. In Ghana, women carry a higher prevalence and incidence of HIV. The study's objectives were to understand the experiences of women living with HIV/AIDS on ART and determine the barriers and enablers for ART uptake from the perspective of both the females living with HIV and their healthcare providers in the Upper East Regional Hospital of Ghana.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a qualitative study that used interviews to acquire data from women living with HIV on the perceived barriers and enablers for ART. The Upper East Regional Hospital in Ghana was the study site. We used a phenomenological approach to explore the lived experiences, perceptions, and meanings associated with ART among women. We collected data until we reached thematic saturation, interviewing a total of sixteen women living with HIV. We conducted a focus group discussion with nine healthcare workers providing care at the ART clinic. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Women living with HIV and their healthcare providers viewed an environment that provided encouragement and support from healthcare workers and patients' relatives, the ability to conceal HIV status, peer counselling, and the perceived benefits of therapy as enablers of ART uptake and medication adherence. The following were barriers to ART uptake and adherence: ill health, forgetfulness, long distances to ART clinics, cultural and spiritual beliefs, and fear of stigma.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Enablers of ART uptake should be expanded upon and encouraged so that women living with HIV/AIDS can access drugs in a timely and stress-free manner. On the other hand, the barriers identified can be addressed through education, the expansion of healthcare infrastructure, and the economic empowerment of women.
