A Survey of Surrogates and Health Care Professionals Indicates Support of Cognitive Motor Dissociation-Assisted Prognostication

Background:
        
      
      Prognostication of patients with acute disorders of consciousness is imprecise but more accurate technology-supported predictions, such as cognitive motor dissociation (CMD), are emerging. CMD refers to the detection of willful brain activation following motor commands using functional magnetic resonance imaging or machine learning-supported analysis of the electroencephalogram in clinically unresponsive patients. CMD is associated with long-term recovery, but acceptance by surrogates and health care professionals is uncertain. The objective of this study was to determine receptiveness for CMD to inform goals of care (GoC) decisions and research participation among health care professionals and surrogates of behaviorally unresponsive patients.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was a two-center study of surrogates of and health care professionals caring for unconscious patients with severe neurological injury who were enrolled in two prospective US-based studies. Participants completed a 13-item survey to assess demographics, religiosity, minimal acceptable level of recovery, enthusiasm for research participation, and receptiveness for CMD to support GoC decisions.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Completed surveys were obtained from 196 participants (133 health care professionals and 63 surrogates). Across all respondents, 93% indicated that they would want their loved one or the patient they cared for to participate in a research study that supports recovery of consciousness if CMD were detected, compared to 58% if CMD were not detected. Health care professionals were more likely than surrogates to change GoC with a positive (78% vs. 59%, p = 0.005) or negative (83% vs. 59%, p = 0.0002) CMD result. Participants who reported religion was the most important part of their life were least likely to change GoC with or without CMD. Participants who identified as Black (odds ratio [OR] 0.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.36) or Hispanic/Latino (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.2-0.75) and those for whom religion was the most important part of their life (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.64) were more likely to accept a lower minimum level of recovery.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Technology-supported prognostication and enthusiasm for clinical trial participation was supported across a diverse spectrum of health care professionals and surrogate decision-makers. Education for surrogates and health care professionals should accompany integration of technology-supported prognostication.
