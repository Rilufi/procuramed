Social determinants for understanding Muslims' intentions toward seeking mental health help based on the Theory of Planned Behavior

Background:
        
      
      Many have found that minorities seek help for mental health problems less than the general population. Such findings are surprising considering that minorities experience higher rates of mental health issues compared to the general population.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      Employing the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), this study aimed to explore the intentions of Muslims living in California and Israel pertaining seeking mental health help (SMHH).
    


          Method and design:
        
      
      A qualitative approach involving semi-structured interviews guided by TPB principles was conducted with 78 participants. Thematic analysis was implemented to identify key themes.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Five major themes were identified: 1 - Attitudes: Normalization of SMHH entangled with fear; causes and attributions of mental health disorders; perspectives on treatment. 2 - Subjective norms: Support groups; stigma and social norms. 3 - Perceived behavioral control: Personal and environmental facilitators and barriers. 4 - Intentions: High; conditioned preapproval; and low. 5 - Actual help seeking behavior: Religious figures as first resort; incorporating religious practices, and preference of Muslim therapist. Cultural beliefs, stigma, social support, and religion elements were dominant in the TPB model.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The findings underscored the holistic approach among Muslims toward seeking mental help incorporating medical, psychological, social, and spiritual understanding of the mental health condition. This suggests considering social and communal elements in developing interventions, education, and policy for SMHH among Muslims.
