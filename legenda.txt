The associations between resilience, self-care, and burnout among medical students

Burnout is a work-related stress syndrome with substantial consequences for patients, physicians, and medical students. Personal resilience, i.e., the ability to bounce back and thrive despite challenging circumstances, and certain practices, such as self-care, may protect individuals from burnout. However, limited information exists on the complex relationships between resilience, different self-care practices, and burnout. Understanding these associations is important for designing efficient interventions within medical schools. Therefore, the present study examined the direct and indirect associations through a cross-sectional study among 95 fourth-year medical students. Self-reported questionnaires measured resilience, self-care dimensions (stress management, spiritual growth, interpersonal relations, health responsibility), and burnout dimensions (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal accomplishment). Data were analyzed via IBM-SPSS and PROCESS-macro. The main results demonstrated that self-care mediated the associations between resilience and burnout: stress management and interpersonal relations mediated the associations with emotional exhaustion, while spiritual growth mediated the association with personal accomplishment. These results highlight that medical students' resilience may encourage self-care behaviors, thus decreasing levels of the burnout dimensions of emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment. Developing curricula that enhance students' resilience through applying self-care techniques in stressful situations may reduce the negative impact of burnout in healthcare.
