Through traveling and camping, playing sports, improving children, youth and adults in places of active recreation (≪dwellings,≫ ≪half-dwellings,≫ ≪cuttings,≫ etc.), the philosophy of health conservation took a leading position in the interwar period of the XX century. The physical education movement had particular successes when a wide circle of Ukrainian youth joined it. There was an original Plast method of physical education of a Ukrainian - physically, spiritually, morally, mentally healthy person, for whom health preservation is a way and philosophy of life, a vital need. All this actualizes the problem of health-oriented public initiatives, which should be creatively used in the current challenges in Ukraine.
